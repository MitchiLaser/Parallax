\section{Introduction}

This part explains how the measurement system's hardware works. It aims to make it clear why and how the hardware was designed. Basically, the hardware is meant to convert analog voltages with a high amplitude into smaller ones. Then, we can measure these smaller voltages using the PR2040 Microcontroller on the Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller board.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

Before we talk about how the analog front-end works and the different voltage ranges for the oscilloscope, you need to know some basics about electronics. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Understanding what Charge, Voltage, and Current are
	\item Knowing about electrical resistance, Ohm's Law, and how resistors work
	\item Learning about Capacitance and capacitors
	\item Knowing how to use a Diode and a Z-Diode
\end{itemize}
