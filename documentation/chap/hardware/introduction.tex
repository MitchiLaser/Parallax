\section{Introduction}

This chapter explains the hardware details of the measurement system, aiming to provide a clear understanding of why and how the hardware was designed. In principle the purpose of the measurement hardware is to map analog voltages from a wide input range to a smaller input range, which then can be measured using the PR2040 Microcontroller of the Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller board.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

In order to discuss the structure of the analog front-end and the corresponding voltage ranges for the oscilloscope some basic knowledge in electronics engineering is assumed. This contains the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The definition of Charge, Voltage and Current
	\item The definition of the electrical resistance, Ohms law and resistors as electrical components
	\item Capacitance and capacitors as electrical components
	\item The usage of a Diode and a Z-Diode
\end{itemize}
