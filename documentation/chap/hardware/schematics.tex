\section{Designing the schematics}

\todo[inline]{Explain how the schematics diagram works, how all values were calculated and why some test pins were placed on their locations. Maybe also write something about the pcb layout?}
\todo[inline]{Design the PCB in a way that the backside has no electronic parts but a silk screen of all the schematics (mirrored) and all the test points should also be on this side}
