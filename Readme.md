# Parallax

As a physics student at Karlsruhe KIT I think that some of the work experience experiments are outdated. In order to teach the students something important they have to be renewed. As I heard, most of it has not been changed within the last 25 years while in the outer world integrals can be numerically calculated which replaces the need to print them on paper and weight them (which some people are still doing there).

## Structure of this repository:

There are different groups of experiments for the physics students (P1 ... P4) and the improvement suggestions for them are stored within the folders where the experiment belongs, to make it easier to find the corresponding experiment in case some of the changes might come in use. Furthermore there is a folder with all the experiments for non-physics students and their experiments (P_no_physics). Every experiment has its own number and name which are used the same way as in the work practice course.
